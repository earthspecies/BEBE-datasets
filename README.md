# BEBE-datasets

These are notebooks which format datasets for use in the Biologger Ethogram Benchmark (<https://github.com/earthspecies/BEBE>).

If you would like to format a new bio-logger dataset for use in the BEBE pipeline, it needs to be done in a specific way. We have annotated one of these notebooks (`format_HAR.ipynb`) with a narration of the various steps involved. 

If you have any questions, or you are interested in including your data in future expansion of BEBE, please post an issue here on Github or [contact us](mailto:benjamin@earthspecies.org).
